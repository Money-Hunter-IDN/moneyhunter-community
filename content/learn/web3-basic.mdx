# Web3 Fundamentals

Web3 represents the next evolution of the internet, built on blockchain technology and decentralized principles. Unlike Web2, where data and services are controlled by centralized entities, Web3 empowers users with ownership and control over their digital assets and identity.

## What is Web3?

Web3, also known as the decentralized web, is an internet ecosystem built on blockchain technology that emphasizes:

- **Decentralization**: No single point of control
- **Ownership**: Users own their data and digital assets
- **Transparency**: Open-source and verifiable systems
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can participate without gatekeepers

## Key Components of Web3

### Blockchain Technology

The foundational layer that enables decentralized consensus and immutable record-keeping.

### Smart Contracts

Self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code, enabling trustless interactions.

### Decentralized Applications (dApps)

Applications that run on blockchain networks rather than centralized servers.

### Digital Wallets

Tools that allow users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies and interact with dApps.

## Web2 vs Web3 Comparison

| Aspect         | Web2                        | Web3                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Data Ownership | Platform owns user data     | Users own their data           |
| Identity       | Platform-specific accounts  | Self-sovereign identity        |
| Payments       | Traditional payment systems | Native cryptocurrency payments |
| Governance     | Centralized decision-making | Community governance (DAOs)    |

## Getting Started with Web3

1. **Set up a digital wallet** (MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet)
2. **Learn about blockchain basics**
3. **Explore decentralized applications**
4. **Understand cryptocurrency fundamentals**
5. **Join Web3 communities**
